## Getting the Files

> ## Click the link to download the file
> [data_viz_workshop.zip]({{page.root}}/files/data_viz_workshop.zip)
{: .callout}

The dataset we will be using is taken from the [gapminder][gapminder] dataset, 
just like the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) workshop.
We will also be using a special environment, which can be recreated on your machine using [Anaconda][anaconda].

To obtain the dataset and environment, download the file [data_viz_workshop.zip]({{page.root}}/files/data_viz_workshop.zip).
If given the option, choose to Save File in your Desktop folder. If you are not given the option to choose where to save the file, then
move this zipped file to your Desktop. Finally, double click the zipped file to unzip it.
You should now have a folder called `data_viz_workshop`. If you open this folder, you will see a file called `environment.yml` and a folder called `Data`.

> ## Create the environment before the workshop to save time
> Your instructor may tell you to go ahead and create the `dataviz` environment in advance, and start the workshop from Episode 2 if time is short.
> If so, then go ahead and  create the `dataviz` environment and open Jupyter Lab in the project root directory (`Desktop/data_viz_workshop`). 
> Follow the directions in [Create a new environment]({{page.root}}/01-create-new-environment)).
