## Getting the Files

> ## Click the link to download the file
> [data_viz_workshop.zip]({{page.root}}/files/data_viz_workshop.zip)
{: .callout}

The dataset we will be using is taken from the [gapminder][gapminder] dataset, 
just like the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) workshop.
We will also be using a special environment, which can be recreated on your machine using [Anaconda][anaconda].

To obtain the dataset and environment, download the file [data_viz_workshop.zip]({{page.root}}/files/data_viz_workshop.zip).
If given the option, choose to Save File in your Desktop folder. If you are not given the option to choose where to save the file, then
move this zipped file to your Desktop. Finally, double click the zipped file to unzip it.
You should now have a folder called `data_viz_workshop`. If you open this folder, you will see a file called `environment.yml` and a folder called `Data`.

> ## Create the environment before the workshop to save time
> Your instructor may tell you to go ahead and create the `dataviz` environment in advance, and start the workshop from Episode 2 if time is short.
> If so, then go ahead and  create the `dataviz` environment and open Jupyter Lab in the project root directory (`Desktop/data_viz_workshop`). 
> Follow the directions in [Create a new environment]({{page.root}}/01-create-new-environment)).

## Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)

You can sign up for a GitHub account at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

Make sure to choose a general purpose email that you are likely to still have access to in 5 years - that is, not an email tied to a specific workplace, university, or Internet Service Provider.

Make sure to also choose an appropriate username that you are comfortable putting on your resume or sharing with colleagues - some variation of your name is a good idea.

After you have a GitHub account, you should also download GitHub Desktop, so that you can clone, pull, and push without having to use the command line. You can download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com).
