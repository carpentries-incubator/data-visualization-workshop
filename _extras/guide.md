### If you have limited time

If this lesson should last for strictly 1 hour, it is highly recommended that you have learners complete Episode 1 (Create a New Environment)
before the lesson begins, as a part of Setup.

### This lesson assumes familiarity with python and pandas

It is important to note that this lesson was designed to follow the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) lesson.

### See all of the code

If you want to see all of the finished code as it should be after the lesson is completed (.ipynb and .py files), they are available [in the code folder](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-interactive-data-visualizations/tree/gh-pages/code).
