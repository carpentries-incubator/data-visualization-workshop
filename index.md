This workshop lesson is an introduction to making interactive data visualizations in Python. Learners will create a new environment using [conda][anaconda], wrangle data into the proper format using [pandas][pandas] library, create visualizations using the [Plotly][plotly] Python library, and display these visualizations and create widgets using [Streamlit][streamlit].

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Learners should have completed the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) workshop lesson, or have some experience with Python and the pandas library.
> 2. Learners should have Anaconda installed on their machines, as specified in the [setup for Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup.html).
> 3. Learners should be comfortable with using the command line.
> 4. Learners should have a Jupyter Lab & Streamlit compatible web browser installed (Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
> 5. Learners should have downloaded the required files ([data_viz_workshop.zip]({{page.root}}/files/data_viz_workshop.zip)) as specified in the [Setup](setup.md)
> 6. (Optional) Learners can request a Streamlit Sharing account - [request one here](https://streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up) - if they wish to deploy and publish their visualization web app.
